        Healthcare:
        The German healthcare system is a statutory health insurance system (SHI) financed with equal payments
        divided between an employee and an employer.
        
        SHI enacts comprehensive insurance that covers major surgeries, prescriptions, and sick-pay, without excess
        payments or additional fees.

        need to venture abroad should they require any specialist treatment.
        
        Hygiene is also a crucial of the German healthcare system, and access to the most up-to-date technologies and
        innovative treatments is also widely available.
